Overview - 

For this project, I merged two csv files containing data relative to student test scores in both math and reading for a specific school district. Dataframes were first created for both district and school-wide test scores. Then, dataframes were created to compare test scores between individual schools based on school type (district or charter), school size, and school budget. A written analysis of these findings is also included.
